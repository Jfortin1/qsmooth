	Abstract = {The rat has been used extensively as a model for evaluating chemical toxicities and for understanding drug mechanisms. However, its transcriptome across multiple organs, or developmental stages, has not yet been reported. Here we show, as part of the SEQC consortium efforts, a comprehensive rat transcriptomic BodyMap created by performing RNA-Seq on 320 samples from 11 organs of both sexes of juvenile, adolescent, adult and aged Fischer 344 rats. We catalogue the expression profiles of 40,064 genes, 65,167 transcripts, 31,909 alternatively spliced transcript variants and 2,367 non-coding genes/non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) annotated in AceView. We find that organ-enriched, differentially expressed genes reflect the known organ-specific biological activities. A large number of transcripts show organ-specific, age-dependent or sex-specific differential expression patterns. We create a web-based, open-access rat BodyMap database of expression profiles with crosslinks to other widely used databases, anticipating that it will serve as a primary resource for biomedical research using the rat model.},

@article{Hicks,
	Abstract = {Normalization and preprocessing are essential steps for the analysis of high-throughput data including next-generation sequencing and microarrays. Multi-sample global normalization methods, such as quantile normalization, have been successfully used to remove technical variation from noisy data. These methods rely on the assumption that observed global changes across samples are due to unwanted technical variability. Transforming the data to remove these differences has the potential to remove interesting biologically driven global variation and therefore may not be appropriate depending on the type and source of variation. Currently, it is up to the subject matter experts, for example biologists, to determine if the stated assumptions are appropriate or not. Here, we propose a data-driven method to test for the assumptions of global normalization methods. We demonstrate the utility of our method (quantro), by applying it to multiple gene expression and DNA methylation and show examples of when global normalization methods are not appropriate. We also perform a Monte Carlo simulation study to illustrate how our method generally outperforms the current approach. An R-package implementing our method is available on Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/quantro.html).},
